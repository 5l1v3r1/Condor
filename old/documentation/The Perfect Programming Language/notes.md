What makes a programming language popular?
==========================================
 - The face that you don't have to run any compiler, program, or interpreter to run the code. Here's example from most popular language to least popular
 	- PHP, save and refresh the page runs the code
 	- JS, load into browser and refresh the page
 	 - NodeJs, run through node (hence not as popular)
 	- Python - Save and run through the python command line
 	- Java/C# - Compile and interpreter
 	- C++, compile
 	- C, compile
 	- Assembly - Compile
