# CobraLang [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

CobraLang is intended to be another simple and intuitive programming language. The syntax is familiar by design, but allows for the combining of a few concepts.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/chaseWillden/CobraLang/wiki) for documentation.

Top Problems with Programming
-----------------------------
 - Lack of Code organization
 - Lack of Simplicity
 - Lack of Readability
 - (Java/C#) Not too verbose
 - Too much Memory Management

Building Instructions
---------------------
Building should be fairly easy. Required programs:
 - gcc

For building the CobraLang .a library
```
make all
```
To build all and compile the main.cc found in test/main.cc
```
make || make mt
```
To build and perform a memory test, requires [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) to be installed
```
make mem
```
To clean all object files
```
make clean
```
To debug using terminal, requires [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to be installed
```
make d
```

Todo:
------
 - semantics.cc 186 - add variable types
 - semantics.cc 203 - Inject args into the scope
 - semantics.cc 204 - Stmts after the return stmt should be freed
